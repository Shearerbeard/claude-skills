  Use for any Rust work: writing, planning, reviewing, or editing `.rs` files,
  Cargo.toml, or clippy fixes. Self-correct against LLM-specific failure modes
  the model tends to repeat: clone escapes to satisfy the borrow checker,
  speculative fallbacks for failure modes that don't exist, god modules,
  verbose match chains, and weak error modeling. Provides concrete reference
  patterns (transpose, Arc::clone, newtypes, parse-don't-validate, sealed
  traits) and routes type modeling to rust-design. For formal reviews, use rust-review;
  it applies these rules as a gate checklist.

# Rust Quality — LLM Anti-Pattern Prevention

Reference patterns by name; do not re-explain them. For reviews, use `rust-review`; it loads these rules and applies the review gate checklist.

## Prefer (by name)

- `transpose()` for `Option<Result<T,E>>` → `Result<Option<T>,E>`
- `Arc::clone(&var)` over `var.clone()` on ref-counted types
- `if let` over single-arm `match` (`clippy::single_match`)
- `.to_owned()` over `.to_string()` on `&str` (`clippy::str_to_string`)
- `.map_err(Variant)` over `.map_err(|e| Variant(e))` when `#[from]` exists
- Explicit enum arms over `_ =>` (`clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm`)
- Type aliases over `#[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]`
- `thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for applications (dtolnay split)
- Parse-don't-validate — reject at construction, not at use (corrode.dev)
- Newtype wrappers for stringly-typed parameters
- Sealed traits for public API stability

## Reject (LLM-specific anti-patterns)

**Sprawl**: adding a helper, trait, module, or abstraction for a single use site. Three similar lines beats a premature abstraction.

**God modules**: if a module exceeds ~500 lines, it's doing too many things. Split by domain concept, not by "utils."

**Speculative fallbacks**: don't write a fallback code path for a failure mode that hasn't manifested. Log warn, test first, add the fallback when a real model/runtime actually fails.

**Clone to satisfy the borrow checker**: restructure ownership instead. Move the clone into a let binding, use `Arc`, or redesign the data flow. `clone()` as a borrow checker escape hatch is the #1 LLM code smell.

**Verbose match chains**: if you're matching on the same value 3+ times in sequence, the data model is wrong. Refactor the enum or use combinators.

**Redundant closures**: `.map_err(|e| Error::Variant(e))` when `Error::Variant` is a function pointer via `#[from]`. The closure is noise.

**Transitive dependency assumptions**: if you `use` a crate, it must be in `[dependencies]`. Compiling via a transitive dep is fragile.

**Guards and temps before iterator chains**: don't add a guard conditional or assign a temp variable just to start an iterator chain. Chain directly on the expression.

**Hand-written derivable impls**: don't hand-write a trait impl that a standard derive already covers (`Default`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`). `#[derive]` it.

## Comments

Comments earn their place by explaining "why" when it is not apparent at face
value; very light "what" is tolerable at struct or function level. Never
"how" — the code is the single source of truth for what and how.

- Never restate the type system or the signature ("This is a u32").
- No narration ("// Return the calculated delay"), no meta-development stubs
  ("// Validate skill sources"), no reintroductions ("/// Skills
  configuration - supports directory-based skill discovery").
- Drift hazards: never describe behavior owned by other code or name specific
  crates/libraries in a comment — both go stale when the implementation changes.
- No development-context references — issues, screenshots, "previous behavior"
  / "new behavior". Change narration belongs in the commit or PR, never source.
- Never repeat a comment in multiple places or defend the code just written.

## Type Modeling

Load `rust-design` for type modeling — newtypes and constrained
constructors, illegal-states-unrepresentable enums, railway-oriented
error composition, and types-before-logic. The rules live there; do not
model a new type surface from this skill alone.

## After adding an enum variant

Run `cargo build --workspace` immediately. Fix ALL non-exhaustive match errors before any other change. Don't fix them one at a time across build cycles.

## Clippy baseline

Start with `[workspace.lints.clippy]` enabling category groups at warn. See [kristof-mattei/rust-seed](https://github.com/kristof-mattei/rust-seed/blob/main/Cargo.toml) for the most complete public config (127 restriction lints). Adopt progressively — don't dump all 127 at once.
