  two-reviewer design panel; Layer 2 writes whole-frame golden tests

  manifest, fill order, and the known limits of both signals. Pair with
  rust-design for the type modeling itself, rust-quality for
  anti-patterns in the filled bodies, and gate-probes at each gate.

# Typed Holes and Layered Red-Green

Two layers of machine-tracked holes, filled over time.

- **Layer 1, type-checked surface.** Lay the full type surface with
  `todo!()` bodies. The compiler and clippy verify the design composes
  before any behavior exists. What is still missing is tracked by the
  hole inventory, not by the compiler: `todo!()` is a diverging panic, so
  it type-checks wherever it sits.
- **Layer 2, test-runner-tracked.** Write whole-frame golden tests from
  the spec before the implementation, so they fail on arrival. The test
  runner tracks the rendering and semantics holes the compiler cannot
  see.

The layers are complements, not alternatives. The compiler checks the
surface while the hole inventory tracks the behavior holes; the failing
golden tests track rendering holes. Layer 1 alone is a complete practice
for a module with no rendered output. Layer 2 alone is just snapshot
testing.

Everything needed to run the practice is in this skill. A private
companion repo of templates and worked exemplars augments it where the
user has one; its absence changes nothing about the workflow below.

## Layer 1: the typed-holes skeleton

### What lands

The full type surface, and nothing else:

- Real signatures, real derives, real `From`/`Into` impls, real leaf
  types. No placeholder `String` standing in for a type not yet written.
- `todo!()` appears **only** at real-behavior bodies: parsing, rendering,
  assembly, anything with a decision in it.
- Trivial accessors are implemented, not held open. A field read, or an
  `as_str` over an already-validated value, is not a behavior hole;
  leaving it as `todo!()` hides the type surface from the compiler
  instead of exposing it.
- Fallible constructors return `Result<_, YourError>` with the error enum
  fully written. An error type invented later is a type-surface change,
  which is the thing this step exists to catch early.

Design rules the surface must satisfy are `rust-design`'s: invalid states
unrepresentable, parse rather than validate, no bare domain value across
the public boundary (including through error payloads), public fields
only where every field is itself a validated type.

The boundary rule is scoped to domain values. A diagnostic payload in an
error variant may stay raw text where the variant name and its docs mark
it diagnostic-only and no domain logic branches on it: an unparsed
response body reported next to an unexpected status is the usual case.
Once a caller matches on the contents, it is a domain value and needs a
type.

### The skeleton commit

The skeleton must pass `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` before any body
is implemented, and it lands as **its own commit**. The commit is the
point: it makes the design panel's input a retrievable git object rather
than a conversation. An auditor can check out the skeleton and see
exactly what was reviewed.

Gate the skeleton commit on:

```
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo +nightly fmt --check
```

**Toolchain prerequisites.** `#[expect]` needs Rust 1.81 or newer; on an
older toolchain use `#[allow(unused_variables)]` with a tracking comment
naming the card or issue that fills the body. The `+nightly` form needs a
nightly toolchain installed; where only stable is available, run plain
`cargo fmt --check`.

### The `#[expect]` marker convention

Every function that has a `todo!()` body **and at least one parameter**
carries:

```rust
#[expect(unused_variables, reason = "todo!() body; filled by <card or issue>")]
```

Use `expect`, not `allow`. While the lint fires the two behave alike, and
once it stops firing `expect` warns, so the marker asks to be removed at
the point it stops being true. Two limits belong in the same breath,
because the marker is easy to oversell:

- **A zero-parameter hole has nothing to mark.** With no parameters there
  is no `unused_variables` to expect, the expectation is unfulfilled the
  moment it is written, and `unfulfilled_lint_expectations` fails the
  skeleton's own `-D warnings` gate. Leave those functions unmarked; the
  hole inventory tracks them.
- **A filled body can keep its own marker alive.** The expectation goes
  unfulfilled only when the filled body uses *every* parameter, so a body
  that lands while still ignoring one argument keeps a marker that looks
  legitimate. Each fill unit's checklist carries an explicit marker
  sweep; do not rely on the compiler to ask for one.

The module-level counterpart is `#![allow(dead_code)]` on skeleton entry,
removed in slices as the holes fill. Like the per-function marker, it
needs an explicit removal step in the fill plan.

### The hole inventory

`todo!()` is a diverging panic, not debt the compiler tracks. A skeleton
full of them passes check and clippy alike, which is what the skeleton
commit is for and also its blind spot. Track the holes explicitly, by one
of two routes.

- **Lint config available.** Enable `clippy::todo` at **warn** for the
  fill phase (a `[lints]` entry in `Cargo.toml`, or `#![warn(clippy::todo)]`
  at crate entry), and flip it to **deny** as the completion gate for the
  last fill unit. The lint is allow-by-default, and denying it from the
  skeleton commit onward would fail the skeleton's own clippy gate, so
  the order matters.
- **Lint config not available.** Keep a deterministic inventory instead.
  `grep -rn 'todo!(' src/` at the skeleton commit is the baseline; each
  fill unit re-runs it and accounts for every line that changed, so no
  hole outlives the card that owned it.

### The type-to-business-rule map

Every public type in the skeleton maps to **one** business rule, with the
invalid state it forbids named explicitly. The map lives in a `DESIGN.md`
co-located with the module, alongside a visibility and seam table (what
the module reaches into, at what visibility, which accessors are
test-only) and the named residual risks.

A type that cannot be given a one-line business rule is a signal, not a
formatting problem: it is usually two types, or a bag with no invariant
to defend.

## The design panel

Between the skeleton commit and the first implemented body, the types
pass a review panel of **two** context-isolated reviewers.

1. **Adversarial invalid-states reviewer.** Applies the design rules
   against the types: which invalid states can these types still
   represent? Does any type encode a state production cannot reach?
2. **Second-model logic reviewer.** A different model family from the
   author, reading the skeleton for logic, ordering, and seam errors.

Both seats read the skeleton commit in a fresh context, with no memory of
the design conversation. Give each the file paths, the design record, and
its own question set.

Seat 1, invalid states:

- Which invalid states can these types still represent? Try to construct
  a well-typed, meaningless value. Cross-field combinations count.
- Does any type encode a state production cannot reach? An always-`Some`
  option or an unreachable variant is surface that tests will cover while
  proving nothing.
- Does any bare `String`, `usize`, or unbounded collection cross the
  public boundary, including through error variants and serialization
  derives? Raw diagnostic text in an error variant is the one allowed
  exception, when its docs mark it diagnostic-only and nothing branches
  on it.
- Does every public type map to exactly one business rule? Two rules mean
  two types; none means a bag.
- Do fallible constructors return `Result`, with downstream code taking
  only already-valid types? A validate-then-use path anywhere is a
  finding.
- Do the serde derives mean what the types mean? Check every derive whose
  behavior is not obvious from the type.
- Are public fields confined to structs where every field is itself a
  validated type?

Seat 2, logic and seams:

- Spec-to-type mismatches: a spec rule with no type enforcing it, or a
  type enforcing what the spec does not say.
- Ordering and sequencing the spec fixes and the types leave free, or fix
  wrongly.
- Seam errors: what the module reaches into, at what visibility, and
  whether the design record's visibility table is accurate.
- Coverage claims the types cannot support.
- Synthetic states: fixture or builder types that assemble combinations
  production never produces.
- Error modeling: does the enum distinguish the failure modes a caller
  acts on differently, and collapse the ones it must not?

Both seats return numbered findings, each marked blocking or minor, each
with the repair the reviewer would make. An empty return is a failed
review; a clean review says PASS explicitly.

**Findings are numbered, and each carries its disposition individually.**
An accepted finding's disposition is the repair; a rejected finding's is
the reason. Aggregate counts ("8 findings, all addressed") are a failure
of the practice, because no auditor can reconstruct which repair answered
which finding. The ledger row per finding is: number, finding,
disposition, repair or reason, author model, reviewer model. Keep it
where an auditor will find it, in the module's `DESIGN.md` or the card's
review directory if a board is in use.

Keep the reviewer-differs-from-author invariant across both layers: the
model that wrote the skeleton does not sit in the panel's second seat,
and the model that filled a body does not review that fill. The two model
columns in the ledger are what make that invariant auditable.

The panel is required, not optional. In its founding use it caught a
fixture type encoding a production-unreachable state and a number of
logic issues, before any body existed to debug.

## Layer 2: golden frames written to fail first

### The shape

Expect-style golden tests of **whole rendered frames**, not string
fragments. Where the unit under test emits a request envelope, a rendered
prompt, a serialized message, or any other complete artifact, the test
snapshots the complete artifact: every surface of it, in one snapshot.

The failure mode this replaces is the accumulation of string assertions,
one unit of work at a time. Twenty tests each asserting one substring
cost more to maintain than one snapshot of the whole frame, and they
leave the gaps between the substrings uncovered and unnamed.

### Written from the spec, failing on arrival

Write the goldens **before** the implementation, from the spec, so they
fail on arrival. That is what makes them Layer 2: the failing test is the
hole, the same way `todo!()` is the hole in Layer 1. A golden written
after the implementation records what the code does; a golden written
before it records what the code should do.

Practically: accept no snapshot until the body it covers is implemented.
Run the suite with snapshot auto-acceptance disabled in CI and at every
gate, so an unreviewed accepted snapshot cannot pass.

### The coverage manifest

Commit a manifest that maps every surface and branch to the fixture
covering it, and explicitly names the surfaces it leaves uncovered.

The exclusion rows are where the value is. A manifest listing only
covered rows is a table of contents; a manifest whose exclusion rows
carry reasons and name the tests that still own those paths is a coverage
argument. Every exclusion row states either why the surface needs no
coverage or which other test owns it.

The manifest also states the **scope of the identity claim**: which
surfaces a passing snapshot proves unchanged. Be explicit that a green
snapshot suite proves the artifact is unchanged, and never that behavior
downstream of the artifact is unchanged.

### Normalization

Nondeterministic bytes (timestamps, hash-map iteration order) need
normalization before snapshotting. Two rules keep normalization from
silently absorbing real drift:

- **Location-anchored, not text-global.** Rewrite at the structural
  position that produces the nondeterminism (this message, at this
  offset, inside this named span), operating on the structured artifact
  before it is flattened into the snapshot document. A global regex over
  flattened text can rewrite a payload byte that happens to look like a
  marker.
- **Audited.** Before any pass rewrites anything, assert that the
  artifact contains exactly the occurrences the passes expect, and panic
  otherwise. A marker appearing in a payload, or a marker missing where
  the builder should have emitted one, is a loud failure and never a
  silent skip.

### Byte-identity mode for refactor work

Provide an assertion mode that asserts the rendered frame is
byte-identical to the committed baseline, and use it as the acceptance
gate for refactor work that must not change output.

**Prove the mode before trusting it**, with both controls:

- a positive control: a real refactor that changes no behavior leaves the
  whole suite green;
- a negative control: a deliberate one-byte change fails exactly the
  snapshots that cover it and leaves the rest green.

A mode proven only by the positive control cannot be distinguished from a
mode that asserts nothing. Record both transcripts in the design record.

## Fill order

1. Skeleton commit (Layer 1), green under check, clippy, and fmt.
2. Design panel; numbered findings with per-finding dispositions; repairs
   land before any body.
3. Golden frames written to fail first from the spec (Layer 2), plus the
   coverage manifest.
4. Fill bodies one at a time, running `cargo check` after each to narrow
   the next hole's types. Each fill sweeps its own `#[expect]` markers,
   accounts for its lines in the hole inventory, and flips its golden
   frames from red to green. The two signals must agree: a body that
   compiles clean while its golden stays red is a rendering hole the
   compiler was always blind to, which is the case Layer 2 exists for.
5. Remove the module-level `#![allow(dead_code)]` slice by slice as the
   surface goes live, and close the inventory: `clippy::todo` at deny, or
   a `grep` that returns nothing.

Where the work is split across cards or issues, the skeleton is one unit
of work and each fill is another. The skeleton unit's acceptance is
"compiles, lints, panel dispositioned"; a fill unit's acceptance is "its
markers swept and its inventory lines accounted for, with its goldens
green". Run `gate-probes` at those boundaries, and `rust-quality` over
each filled body.

Delegation follows the same split: the skeleton is the expensive design
step and the fills are cheap, so a stronger model lays the type surface
and smaller models fill bodies against green-when-done criteria. Two
cautions. API-convention drift accumulates across executors even when
every per-unit gate passes (inherent `as_str` with no `AsRef` impl,
function-local consts, `as_str().to_owned()` chains, render-level
placeholders papering over source-level optionality), because per-unit
gates cannot see a cross-unit trend; bake the conventions into executor
briefs and the review checklist. And an executor outside a harness that
loads skills receives only its brief, so for those executors the brief
quotes these rules instead of naming skills. Copy the block below into
the brief, fill the angle brackets, and keep only the half that matches
the unit.

## Known limits

Record these as standing limits, and record future failures against them
as correctives rather than as refutations of the technique.

- **The compile surface misses partly-private ingress gaps.** A real
  defect of this class survived a green skeleton: the type surface was
  correct at the module boundary while an ingress path at a narrower
  visibility bypassed it. The compiler cannot see it, because nothing
  ill-typed is written. Agent review at the design panel caught it, which
  is one reason the panel is not optional. A deterministic full-surface
  oracle that enumerates every ingress path regardless of visibility is
  the open answer, not yet built.
- **Runtime semantic mismatches are unattested.** The technique has never
  been shown to catch a defect where the types compose correctly and the
  runtime meaning is wrong. Do not claim it does. When a defect of this
  class appears, record it as a corrective against the practice.
- **The value is downstream of the signals.** The practice is only as
  trustworthy as `cargo check`, clippy, and derive behavior; where a
  signal is weak, the practice inherits the weakness. Serde is the worked
  case. `serde(untagged)` tries the variants in declaration order and
  returns the first that deserializes, so an enum whose variants have
  overlapping field shapes can take a payload as the wrong variant: a
  subset variant declared first swallows the superset's payload. That is
  runtime deserialization behavior and the compiler never flags it. What
  the typing stage buys is that the risk is visible by inspecting the
  overlapping field shapes in the declaration, so the panel checks every
  derive whose behavior is not obvious from the type.
- **A green golden suite is not behavioral evidence.** It proves the
  artifact bytes are unchanged. Downstream work must not read it as proof
  that behavior, scores, or user-visible outcomes are unchanged.
